#+title: M1 MacBook Nix-Darwin Flakes System

This is the nix-flake setup for my M1 Air, plagiarized from [[https://gist.github.com/jmatsushita/5c50ef14b4b96cb24ae5268dab613050][this gist]].

To switch to a new version of the system, clone this repository and run these:
1. ~nix build .#darwinConfigurations.mair.system~
2. ~./result/sw/bin/darwin-rebuild switch --flake .~
